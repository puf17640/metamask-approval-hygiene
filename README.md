# Metamask Approval Hygiene

## With the latest Badger exploit let's talk about Metamask approval hygiene

### 1. Know what you are approving

>#### Check the approved address *YOURSELF*. Do not trust the site's UI. Take the address **manually** from the metamask data and look at the contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io), [Polygonscan](https//etherscan.io), [BSCscan](https://bscscan.com) or [Solscan](https://solscan.io)
